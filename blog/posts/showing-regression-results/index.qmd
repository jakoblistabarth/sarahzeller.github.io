In this post, we have a look at creating a basic regression table with `modelsummary` and `fixest`.

# Setup

First, we load the necessary libraries.

```{r}
#| label: setup
library(fixest)
library(modelsummary)
library(dplyr)
library(labelled)
library(flextable)
```

Then, we prepare the data. We simply use the data that comes with the `fixest` package. For a prettier output in the table later on, we add a label to our variable of interest.

```{r}
#| label: prepare-data
data(trade)
trade_labelled <- trade |> 
  dplyr::mutate(log_dist_km = labelled(dist_km, label = "Log (distance [km])"))
```

As a next step, we run two regressions: One with Fixed Effects, the other one with a Poisson Pseudo-Maximum-Likelihood (PPML) model. With this, we have a very basic Gravity Model in two variations.

```{r}
#| label: regressions
gravity_ols <- feols(Euros ~ log_dist_km | Origin + Destination + Product + Year, trade_labelled)
gravity_pois = fepois(Euros ~ log_dist_km | Origin + Destination + Product + Year, trade_labelled)
```

# Creating a table

We're already all set to create a regression table.

## Basic table

Creating a summary table of our equations is very straight-forward with `modelsummary`: We create a list of the models we want to show, and then input that to `modelsummary`.

```{r}
#| label: tbl-regression-basic
#| tbl-cap: Some regressions -- basic


list(gravity_ols,
     gravity_pois) |>
  modelsummary()
```

## Prettier table

However, the output in @tbl-regression-basic is not very pretty yet. Let's customize it!

First, let's change the labels for our regression. We do this by adding names to the list's input (lines 1--2).

As a next step, let's use the label we added earlier on, by setting `coef_rename` to true. Then, let's omit some of the goodnes-of-fit (gof) indicators, since we don't need all of them here. We do this with a regex in the `gof_omit` argument: anything that matches the expression in line 4 will not be included.

Lastly, I'm used to adding stars where a coefficient is significant. This is not added by default, so let's simply set the `stars` argument to true.

```{r}
#| label: tbl-regression-prettier
#| tbl-cap: Some regressions -- prettier
#| code-line-numbers: true

list(OLS = gravity_ols,
     Poisson = gravity_pois) |>
  modelsummary(coef_rename = TRUE,
               gof_omit = "AIC|BIC|RMSE",
               stars = TRUE,
               output = "table.png")
```

## For advanced features, check out the documentation

These are some pretty normal results. However, you may to e.g. bootstrap standard errors, omit coefficients, or add more information. I really recommend checking out `modelsummary`'s [documentation](https://modelsummary.com/)!
